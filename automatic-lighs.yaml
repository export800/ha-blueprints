  name: Automatic Lighting (Motion + Presence; Helper-Driven Durations)
  description: >
    Motion- and presence-activated lighting with multi-stage dimming controlled by helper entities.
    - Motion: binary_sensor (device_class=motion)
    - Presence: binary_sensor (device_class=occupancy/presence), person, device_tracker, and Presence Devices (device registry)
    - On activity (motion/presence entities): set occupied brightness (fast normal, instant at night).
    - Night mode: uses a dedicated off timeout and skips dimming stages.
    - No-activity pipeline: Secondary -> Third -> Off (minutes via helpers).
    - Presence Devices participate in activity detection for waits/inactivity checks (via device_entities()),
      but cannot act as direct triggers; include entities in presence fields to trigger "on".
    - Requires automatic_lighting ON and ALL selected manual_adjust flags OFF to run.
